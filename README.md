# Scraping-with-Yelp
This project combines the use of the **Yelp API** and **web scraping with Selenium and BeautifulSoup** to collect business data from various U.S. cities.

## Features

- Fetches businesses by location and category (marketing, advertising, web design) using the Yelp API
- Saves data to a CSV file (`ccc.csv`)
- Opens business pages using Selenium and scrapes extra information (e.g., business name)
- Saves scraped data to an Excel file (`scraped_data.xlsx`)
